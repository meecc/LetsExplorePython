## Maths Operators
----

Python supports most common maths operations. The table below lists maths operators supported.


| Syntax 	| Math 	| Operation Name 	|
|--------------	|-------------------------------------------	|------------------------------------------------------------------	|
| `a+b` 	| a+b 	| addition 	|
| `a-b` 	| a-b 	| subtraction 	|
| a*b 	|  a \* b   | multiplication 	|
| a/b 	|  a\div b  | division (see note below) 	|
| a//b 	|  a//b 	| floor division (e.g. 5//2=2) 	|
| a%b 	|  a%b 	| modulo 	| 
| -a 	| -a | negation 	| 
| <    | a < b | less- than           | 
| >    | a > b  | greater- than        |
| <=   | a <= b | less- than- equal    |
| >=   | a >= b | greater- than- equal |
| abs(a)| <code>&#124; a &#124;</code>	| absolute value 	|
| a**b 	| a**b 	| exponent 	|
| math.sqrt(a) 	|  sqrt a  	| square root 	|



> **Note**:
In order to use `math.sqrt()` function, you must explicitly load the math module by adding ```import math``` at the top of your file, where all the other modules import is defined.


```python
# Sample Code
# Say Cheese
x = 34 - 23 
y = "!!! Say" 
z = 3.45
print(id(x), id(y), id(z))
print(x, y, z)
x = x + 1
y = y + " Cheese !!!"
print("x = " + str(x))
print(y)
print("Is x > z", x > z ,"and y is", y, "and x =", x)
print("x - z =", x - z)

print("~~"*30)

print(id(x), id(y), id(z))
```

    1688760096 2758593865912 2758591273144
    11 !!! Say 3.45
    x = 12
    !!! Say Cheese !!!
    Is x > z True and y is !!! Say Cheese !!! and x = 12
    x - z = 8.55
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    1688760128 2758593996816 2758591273144



```python
t = x > z
print("x = " + str(x) + " and z = " + str(z) + " : " + str(t))
print("x =", x, "and z =", z, ":", t)
print(x, z)
print("x % z =", x % z )
print("x >= z", x <= z)
```

    x = 12 and z = 3.45 : True
    x = 12 and z = 3.45 : True
    12 3.45
    x % z = 1.6499999999999995
    x >= z False



```python
mass_kg = int(input("What is your mass in kilograms?" ))
mass_stone = mass_kg * 1.1 / 7
print("You weigh", mass_stone, "stone.")
```

    What is your mass in kilograms?69
    You weigh 10.842857142857143 stone.


## Order of Operations
---
Python uses the standard order of operations as taught in Algebra and Geometry classes. That, mathematical expressions are evaluated in the following order (memorized by many as PEMDAS or BODMAS).

(Note that operations which share a table row are performed from left to right. That is, a division to the left of a multiplication, with no parentheses between them, is performed before the multiplication simply because it is to the left.)


| Name 	| Syntax 	| Description 	| PEMDAS Mnemonic 	|
|----------------------------	|----------	|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	|-----------------	|
| Parentheses 	| ( ... ) 	| Before operating on anything else, Python must evaluate all parentheticals starting at the innermost level. (This includes functions.) 	| Please 	|
| Exponents 	| \** 	| As an exponent is simply short multiplication or division, it should be evaluated before them. 	| Excuse 	|
| Multiplication and Division 	| * / // % 	| Again, multiplication is rapid addition and must, therefore, happen first. 	| My Dear 	|
| Addition and Subtraction 	| + - 	| They should happen independent to one another and finally operated among eachother 	| Aunt Sally 	|

## Formatting output
---
### round()



```python
print (round(3.14159265, 2))
```
