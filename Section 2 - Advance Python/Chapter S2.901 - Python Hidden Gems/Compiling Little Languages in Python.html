</p><h2> Abstract</h2>
``Little languages'' such as configuration files or HTML documents
are commonplace in computing.  This paper divides the work of
implementing a little language into four parts, and presents a
framework which can be used to easily conquer the implementation
of each.  The pieces of the framework have the unusual property
that they may be extended through normal object-oriented means, allowing
features to be added to a little language simply by subclassing
parts of its compiler.
<p>
</p><p>
      </p><h2><a name="tth_sEc1">
1</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Introduction</h2>

<p>
Domain-specific languages, or ``little languages,'' are frequently encountered
when dealing with computers [<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20010414061914/http://www.foretec.com/python/workshops/1998-11/proceedings/papers/aycock-little/aycock-little.html#bentley" name="CITEbentley">3</a>].  Configuration
files, HTML documents, shell
scripts - all are little structured languages, yet may lack the generality and
features of full-blown programming languages.  Whether writing an interpreter
for a little language, or compiling a little language into another language,
compiler techniques can be used.

</p><p>
In many cases, an extremely fast compiler is not needed, especially if the input
programs tend to be small.  Instead, issues can predominate
such as compiler development time, maintainability of the compiler, and
the ability to easily add new language features.  This is Python's
strong suit.

</p><p>
This paper describes some successful techniques I developed while working
on two compilers for little languages: one for a subset of Java, the other
an optimizing compiler for Guide, a CGI-programming
language [<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20010414061914/http://www.foretec.com/python/workshops/1998-11/proceedings/papers/aycock-little/aycock-little.html#levy" name="CITElevy">12</a>].  The net
result is a framework which can be used to implement little languages easily.

</p><p>
      </p><h2><a name="tth_sEc2">
2</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Model of a Compiler</h2>

<p>
Like most nontrivial pieces of software, compilers are generally
broken down into more manageable modules, or phases.  The design
issues involved and the details of each phase are too numerous
to discuss here in depth; there are many excellent books on the
subject, such as [<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20010414061914/http://www.foretec.com/python/workshops/1998-11/proceedings/papers/aycock-little/aycock-little.html#dragon" name="CITEdragon">1</a>] and [<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20010414061914/http://www.foretec.com/python/workshops/1998-11/proceedings/papers/aycock-little/aycock-little.html#appel" name="CITEappel">2</a>].

</p><p>
I began with a simple model of a compiler having only four phases, as shown in
Figure&nbsp;<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20010414061914/http://www.foretec.com/python/workshops/1998-11/proceedings/papers/aycock-little/aycock-little.html#model">1</a>:

</p><center><img src="./Compiling Little Languages in Python_files/model.gif" alt="model.gif"><br></center> <center>      Figure 1: Compiler model.</center><a name="model">
</a>
<p>
</p><p>

</p><ol type="1">
<li> Scanning, or lexical analysis.  Breaks the input stream into a list
	of tokens.  For example, the expression ``2 + 3 * 5''
	can be broken up into five tokens: number plus
	number times number.  The values 2, 3, and 5 are attributes
	associated with the corresponding number token.
		
<p>

</p></li><li> Parsing, or syntax analysis.  Ensures that a list of tokens
	has valid syntax
	according to a grammar - a set of rules that describes
	the syntax of the language.
	For the above example, a typical expression grammar would be:
	
<pre>		expr ::= expr + term
		expr ::= term
		term ::= term * factor
		term ::= factor
		factor ::= number
	</pre>
	In English, this grammar's rules say that an expression can be
	an expression plus a term, an expression may be a term by itself,
	and so on.  Intuitively, the symbol on the
	left-hand side of ``::='' may be
	thought of as a variable for which the symbols on the right-hand
	side may be substituted.  Symbols that don't appear on any
	left-hand side - like +, *, and number - correspond to
	the tokens from the scanner.

<p>
	The result of my parsing is an abstract syntax tree (AST), which
	represents the input program.  For ``2 + 3 * 5,'' the AST would
	look like the one in Figure&nbsp;<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20010414061914/http://www.foretec.com/python/workshops/1998-11/proceedings/papers/aycock-little/aycock-little.html#ast">2</a>.

</p><p><a name="tth_fIg2">

</p><p>

</p><center><img src="./Compiling Little Languages in Python_files/ast.gif" alt="ast.gif"><br></center> <center>      Figure 2: Abstract syntax tree (AST).</center><a name="ast">
</a>
<p>
</p><p>
		
</p></li><li> Semantic analysis.  Traverses the AST one or more times, collecting
	information and checking that the input program had no semantic
	errors.  In a typical programming language, this phase would
	detect things like type conflicts, redefined identifiers,
	mismatched function parameters, and numerous other errors.  The
	information gathered may be stored in a global symbol table,
	or attached as attributes to the nodes of the AST itself.
		
<p>

</p></li><li> Code generation.  Again traversing the AST, this phase may directly
	interpret the program, or output code in C or assembly which
	would implement the input program.  For expressions as
	simple as those in the example, they could be evaluated
	on the fly in this phase.
</li></ol>
<p>
		Each phase performs a well-defined task, and passes a data structure
on to the next phase.  Note that information only flows one way, and
that each phase runs to completion before the next one starts
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20010414061914/http://www.foretec.com/python/workshops/1998-11/proceedings/papers/aycock-little/aycock-little.html#tthFtNtAAB" name="tthFrefAAB"><sup>1</sup></a>.  This is
in contrast to oft-used techniques which have a symbiosis between scanning
and parsing, where not only may several phases be working concurrently,
but a later phase may send some feedback to modify the operation of an earlier
phase.

</p><p>
Certainly all little language compilers won't fit this model, but it is
extremely clean and elegant for those that do.  The main function of the
compiler, for instance, distills into three lines which reflect
the compiler's structure:

</p><pre>	f = open(filename)
	generate(semantic(parse(scan(f))))
	f.close()
</pre>

<p>
In the remainder of this paper, I will examine each of the above four phases,
showing how my framework can be used to implement the little
expression language above.  Following this will be a discussion of some
of the inner workings of the framework's classes.

</p><p>
      </p><h2><a name="tth_sEc3">
3</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;The Framework</h2>

<p>
A common theme throughout this framework is that the user should have
to do as little work as possible.  For each phase, my framework supplies
a class which performs most of the work.  The user's job is simply to
create subclasses which customize the framework.

</p><p>
      </p><h3><a name="tth_sEc3.1">
3.1</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Lexical Analysis</h3>

<p>
Lexical analyzers, or scanners, are typically implemented one of two ways.  The
first way is to write the scanner by hand; this may still be the method of choice
for very small languages, or where use of a tool to generate scanners
automatically is not possible.  The second method is
to use a scanner generator tool, like lex [<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20010414061914/http://www.foretec.com/python/workshops/1998-11/proceedings/papers/aycock-little/aycock-little.html#levine" name="CITElevine">11</a>],
which takes a high-level description of the permitted tokens, and produces a
finite state machine which implements the scanner.

</p><p>
Finite state machines are equivalent to regular expressions; in fact, one
uses regular expressions to specify tokens to scanner generators!  Since Python
has regular expression support, it is natural to use them to specify tokens.
(As a case in point, the Python module ``tokenize'' has regular expressions
to tokenize Python programs.)

</p><p>
So GenericScanner, my generic scanner class, requires a user to create
a subclass of it in which they specify the regular expressions that
the scanner should look for.  Furthermore, an ``action'' consisting
of arbitrary Python code can be associated with each regular
expression - this is typical of scanner generators, and
allows work to be performed based on the type of token found.

</p><p>
Below is a simple scanner to tokenize expressions.  The parameter to the action
routines is a string containing the part of the input that was matched by the
regular expression.

</p><p>

</p><pre>class SimpleScanner(GenericScanner):
    def __init__(self):
        GenericScanner.__init__(self)
    
    def tokenize(self, input):
        self.rv = []
        GenericScanner.tokenize(self, input)
        return self.rv
    
    def t_whitespace(self, s):
        r' \s+ '
        pass
        
    def t_op(self, s):
        r' \+ | \* '
        self.rv.append(Token(type=s))
        
    def t_number(self, s):
        r' \d+ '
        t = Token(type='number', attr=s)
        self.rv.append(t)
</pre>

<p>
Each method whose name begins with ``t_'' is an action; the regular
expression for the action is placed in the method's documentation
string.  (The reason for this unusual design is explained in
Section&nbsp;<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20010414061914/http://www.foretec.com/python/workshops/1998-11/proceedings/papers/aycock-little/aycock-little.html#reflect">4.1</a>.)

</p><p>
When the tokenize method is called, a list of Token instances is returned, one
for each operator and number found.  The code for the Token class is
omitted; it is a simple container class with a type and an optional
attribute.  White space is skipped by SimpleScanner, since its action code
does nothing.  Any unrecognized characters in the input are matched by a default
pattern, declared in the action GenericScanner.t_default.  This default method
can of course be overridden in a subclass.  A trace of SimpleScanner
on the input ``2 + 3 * 5'' is shown in Table&nbsp;<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20010414061914/http://www.foretec.com/python/workshops/1998-11/proceedings/papers/aycock-little/aycock-little.html#trace">1</a>.

<p>
</p><p>
Scanners made with GenericScanner are extensible, meaning that new tokens
may be recognized simply by subclassing.  To extend SimpleScanner to
recognize floating-point number tokens is easy:

</p><p>

</p><pre>class FloatScanner(SimpleScanner):
    def __init__(self):
        SimpleScanner.__init__(self)
        
    def t_float(self, s):
        r' \d+ \. \d+ '
        t = Token(type='float', attr=s)
        self.rv.append(t)
</pre>
			
<p>
How are these classes used?  Typically, all that is needed is to read
in the input program, and pass it to an instance of the scanner:

</p><p>

</p><pre>def scan(f):
    input = f.read()
    scanner = FloatScanner()
    return scanner.tokenize(input)
</pre>

<p>
Once the scanner is done, its result is sent to the parser for syntax analysis.

</p><p>
      </p><h3><a name="tth_sEc3.2">
3.2</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Syntax Analysis</h3><a name="parsing">
</a>

<p>
The outward appearance of GenericParser, my generic parser class, is
similar to that of GenericScanner.

</p><p>
A user starts by creating a subclass of
GenericParser, containing special methods which are named with
the prefix ``p_''.  These special methods encode grammar rules
in their documentation strings; the code in the methods are
actions which get executed when one of the associated grammar
rules are recognized by GenericParser.

</p><p>
The expression parser subclass is shown below.  Here, the actions
are building the AST for the input program.  AST is also a simple
container class; each instance of AST corresponds to a node in
the tree, with a node type and possibly child nodes.

</p><p>

</p><pre>class ExprParser(GenericParser):
    def __init__(self, start='expr'):
        GenericParser.__init__(self, start)
                
    def p_expr_1(self, args):
        ' expr ::= expr + term '
        return AST(type=args[1],
                   left=args[0],
                   right=args[2])
        
    def p_expr_2(self, args):
        ' expr ::= term '
        return args[0]
        
    def p_term_1(self, args):
        ' term ::= term * factor '
        return AST(type=args[1],
                   left=args[0],
                   right=args[2])
        
    def p_term_2(self, args):
        ' term ::= factor '
        return args[0]
        
    def p_factor_1(self, args):
        ' factor ::= number '
        return AST(type=args[0])

    def p_factor_2(self, args):
        ' factor ::= float '
        return AST(type=args[0])
</pre>

<p>
The grammar's start symbol is passed to the constructor.

</p><p>
ExprParser builds the AST from the bottom up.  Figure&nbsp;<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20010414061914/http://www.foretec.com/python/workshops/1998-11/proceedings/papers/aycock-little/aycock-little.html#build">3</a> shows

</p><p>
The ``args'' passed in to the actions are based on a similar idea used by
yacc [<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20010414061914/http://www.foretec.com/python/workshops/1998-11/proceedings/papers/aycock-little/aycock-little.html#levine" name="CITElevine">11</a>], a prevalent parser generator
tool.  Each symbol on a rule's right-hand
side has an attribute associated with it.  For token symbols like +, this
attribute is the token itself.  All other symbols' attributes come from
the return values of actions which, in the above code, means that they
are subtrees of the AST.  The index into args comes from the position of
the symbol in the rule's right-hand side.  In the running example, 
the call to p_expr_1 has <tt>len(args) == 3</tt>: args[0] is
expr's attribute, the left subtree of + in the AST; args[1] is +'s
attribute, the token +; args[2] is term's attribute, the right subtree
of + in the AST.

</p><p>
The routine to use this subclass is straightforward:

</p><p>

</p><pre>def parse(tokens):
    parser = ExprParser()
    return parser.parse(tokens)
</pre>

<p>
Although omitted for brevity, ExprParser can be subclassed to add grammar rules
and actions, the same way the scanner was subclassed.

</p><p>
After syntax analysis, the parser has produced an AST, and verified that the
input program adheres to the grammar rules.  Next, the input's meaning must be
checked by the semantic analyzer.

</p><p>
      </p><h3><a name="tth_sEc3.3">
3.3</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Semantic Analysis</h3>

<p>
Semantic analysis is performed by traversing the AST.  Rather than spread code
to traverse an AST all over the compiler, I 
have a single base class, ASTTraversal, which knows
how to walk the tree.  Subclasses of ASTTraversal
supply methods which get called
depending on what type of node is encountered.

</p><p>
To determine which method to invoke, ASTTraversal
will first look for a method with the same name
as the node type (plus the prefix
``n_''), then will fall back on an optional default
method if no more specific method is found.

</p><p>
Of course, ASTTraversal can supply many different traversal algorithms.  I have
found three useful: preorder, postorder, and a pre/postorder combination.  (The
latter allows methods to be called both on entry to, and exit from, a node.)

</p><p>
For example, say that we want to forbid the mixing of floating-point and integer
numbers in our expressions:

</p><p>

</p><pre>class TypeCheck(ASTTraversal):
    def __init__(self, ast):
        ASTTraversal.__init__(self, ast)
        self.postorder()
        
    def n_number(self, node):
        node.exprType = 'number'
    def n_float(self, node):
        node.exprType = 'float'
        
    def default(self, node):
        # this handles + and * nodes
        leftType = node.left.exprType
        rightType = node.right.exprType
        if leftType != rightType:
            raise 'Type error.'
        node.exprType = leftType
</pre>

<p>
I found the semantic checking code easier to write and understand by taking the
(admittedly less efficient) approach of making multiple traversals of the
AST - each pass performs a single task.

</p><p>
TypeCheck is invoked from a small glue routine:

</p><p>

</p><pre>def semantic(ast):
    TypeCheck(ast)
    #
    #  Any other ASTTraversal classes
    #  for semantic checking would be
    #  instantiated here...
    #
    return ast
</pre>

<p>
After this phase, I have an AST for an input program that is lexically,
syntactically, and semantically correct - but that does
nothing.  The final phase, code generation, remedies this.

</p><p>
      </p><h3><a name="tth_sEc3.4">
3.4</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Code Generation</h3>

<p>
The term ``code generation'' is somewhat of a misnomer.  As already mentioned,
this phase will traverse the AST and implement the input program, either
directly through interpretation, or indirectly by emitting some code.

</p><p>
Our expressions, for instance, can be easily interpreted:

</p><p>

</p><pre>class Interpret(ASTTraversal):
    def __init__(self, ast):
        ASTTraversal.__init__(self, ast)
        self.postorder()
        print ast.value
        
    def n_number(self, node):
        node.value = int(node.attr)
    def n_float(self, node):
        node.value = float(node.attr)
        
    def default(self, node):
        left = node.left.value
        right = node.right.value
        
        if node.type == '+':
            node.value = left + right
        else:
            node.value = left * right
</pre>
				
<p>
In contrast, my two compilers use an ASTTraversal to output an intermediate
representation (IR) which is effectively a machine-independent assembly language.
This IR then gets converted into MIPS assembly code in one compiler, C++ code
in the other.

</p><p>
I am considering ways to incorporate more sophisticated code generation methods
into this framework, such as tree pattern matching with
dynamic programming [<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20010414061914/http://www.foretec.com/python/workshops/1998-11/proceedings/papers/aycock-little/aycock-little.html#iburg" name="CITEiburg">8</a>].

<p>
      </p><h3><a name="tth_sEc4.1">
4.1</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Reflection</h3><a name="reflect">
</a>

<p>
Extensibility presents some interesting design challenges.
The generic classes in the framework, without any modifications made to them,
must be able to divine all the information and actions contained in
their subclasses, subclasses that didn't exist when the generic classes
were created.

</p><p>
Fortunately, an elegant mechanism exists in Python to do just this:
reflection.  Reflection refers to the ability
of a Python program to query and modify itself at run time
(this feature is
also present in other languages, like Java and Smalltalk).

</p><p>
Consider, for example, my generic scanner class.  GenericScanner
searches itself and its subclasses at run time for methods that begin with the
prefix ``t_.''  These methods are the scanner's actions.  The regular
expression
associated with the actions is specified using a well-known method attribute
that can be queried at run time - the method's documentation string.

</p><p>
This wanton abuse of documentation strings can be rationalized.  Documentation
strings are a method of associating meta-information - comments - with
a section of code.  My framework is an extension of that idea.  Instead
of comments intended for humans, however, I have meta-information
intended for use by my framework.  As the number of reflective Python
applications grows, it may be worthwhile to add more formal mechanisms
to Python to support this task.

</p><p>
      </p><h3><a name="tth_sEc4.2">
4.2</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;GenericScanner</h3>

<p>
Internally, GenericScanner works by constructing a single regular expression
which is composed of all the smaller regular expressions it has found in the action
methods' documentation strings.  Each component regular expression is mapped to
its action using Python's symbolic group facility.

</p><p>
Unfortunately, there is a small snag.  Python follows the Perl semantics for
regular expressions rather than the POSIX semantics, which means it follows
the ``first then longest'' rule - the leftmost
part of a regular expression that
matches is always taken, rather than using the longest match.  In the above
example, if GenericScanner were to order the regular expression so that
``<tt>\d+</tt>'' appeared before ``<tt>\d+\.\d+</tt>'', then
the input 123.45 would match as the
number 123, rather than the floating-point number 123.45.  To work around
this, GenericScanner makes two guarantees:

</p><p>

</p><ol type="1">
<li> A subclass' patterns will be matched before any in its parent classes.

<p>

</p></li><li> The default pattern for a subclass, if any, will be matched
	only after all other patterns in the subclass have been tried.
</li></ol>
<p>
One obvious change to GenericScanner is to automate the building of
the list of tokens - each ``t_'' method could return a list
of tokens which would be appended to the scanner's list of tokens.  The
reason this is not done is because it would limit potential applications
of GenericScanner.  For example, in one compiler
I used a subclass of GenericScanner as
a preprocessor which returned a string; another scanner class then
broke that string into a list of tokens.

</p><p>
      </p><h3><a name="tth_sEc4.3">
4.3</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;GenericParser</h3>

<p>
GenericParser is actually more powerful than was alluded to in
Section&nbsp;<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20010414061914/http://www.foretec.com/python/workshops/1998-11/proceedings/papers/aycock-little/aycock-little.html#parsing">3.2</a>.
At the cost of greater coupling between methods,
actions for similar rules may be combined together rather than
having to duplicate code - my original version of ExprParser is shown
below.

</p><p>

</p><pre>class ExprParser(GenericParser):
    def __init__(self, start='expr'):
        GenericParser.__init__(self, start)
                
    def p_expr_term(self, args):
        '''
            expr ::= expr + term
            term ::= term * factor
        '''
        return AST(type=args[1],
                   left=args[0],
                   right=args[2])
        
    def p_expr_term_2(self, args):
        '''
            expr ::= term
            term ::= factor
        '''
        return args[0]
        
    def p_factor(self, args):
        '''
            factor ::= number
            factor ::= float
        '''
        return AST(type=args[0])
</pre>

<p>
Taking this to extremes, if a user is <em>only</em> interested in
parsing and doesn't require an AST, ExprParser could be written:

</p><p>

</p><pre>class ExprParser(GenericParser):
    def __init__(self, start='expr'):
        GenericParser.__init__(self, start)
                
    def p_rules(self, args):
        '''
            expr ::= expr + term
            expr ::= term
            term ::= term * factor
            term ::= factor
            factor ::= number
            factor ::= float
        '''
</pre>

<p>
In theory, GenericParser could use any parsing algorithm for its engine.
However, I chose the Earley parsing algorithm [<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20010414061914/http://www.foretec.com/python/workshops/1998-11/proceedings/papers/aycock-little/aycock-little.html#earley" name="CITEearley">6</a>] which
has several nice properties for this application [<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20010414061914/http://www.foretec.com/python/workshops/1998-11/proceedings/papers/aycock-little/aycock-little.html#grune" name="CITEgrune">10</a>]:

</p><p>

</p><ol type="1">
<li> It is one of the most general algorithms known; it can parse all
	context-free grammars whereas the more popular LL and LR techniques
	cannot.  This is important for easy extensibility; a user should
	ideally be able to subclass a parser without worrying about
	properties of the resulting grammar.

<p>

</p></li><li> It generates all its information at run-time, rather than having to
	precompute sets and tables.  Since the grammar rules aren't known
	until run-time, this is just as well!
</li></ol>
<p>
		Unlike most other parsing algorithms, Earley's method parses ambiguous
grammars.  Currently, ambiguity presents a problem since it is not clear
which actions should be invoked.  Future versions of GenericParser will
have an ambiguity-resolution scheme to address this.

</p><p>
To accommodate a variety of possible
parsing algorithms (including the one I used),
GenericParser only makes one guarantee with respect to when the rules' actions
are executed.  A rule's action is executed only after all the attributes on
the rule's right-hand side are fully computed.  This condition is sufficient
to allow the correct construction of ASTs.
	
</p><p>
      </p><h3><a name="tth_sEc4.4">
4.4</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;ASTTraversal</h3>

<p>
ASTTraversal is the least unusual of the generic classes.  It could be
argued that its use of reflection is superfluous, and the same functionality
could be achieved by having its subclasses provide a method for every
type of AST node; these methods could call a default method themselves
if necessary.

</p><p>
The problems with this non-reflective approach are threefold.  First, it
introduces a maintenance issue: any additional node types added to the
AST require all ASTTraversal's subclasses to be changed.  Second, it
forces the user to do more work, as methods for all node types must
be supplied; my experience, especially for semantic checking, is that
only a small set of node types will be of interest for a given subclass.
Third, some node types may not map nicely into Python method names - I
prefer to use node types that reflect the little language's syntax, like
+, and it isn't possible to have methods named
``n_+''<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20010414061914/http://www.foretec.com/python/workshops/1998-11/proceedings/papers/aycock-little/aycock-little.html#tthFtNtAAC" name="tthFrefAAC"><sup>2</sup></a>.  This latter point is
where it is useful to have ASTTraversal reflectively probe a subclass
and automatically invoke the default method.

</p><p>
      </p><h3><a name="tth_sEc4.5">
4.5</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Design Patterns</h3>

<p>
Although developed independently, the use of reflection in my
framework is arguably a specialization of the Reflection
pattern [<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20010414061914/http://www.foretec.com/python/workshops/1998-11/proceedings/papers/aycock-little/aycock-little.html#posa" name="CITEposa">4</a>].  I
speculate that there
are many other design patterns where reflection can be
exploited.  To illustrate, ASTTraversal wound up
somewhere between the Default Visitor [<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20010414061914/http://www.foretec.com/python/workshops/1998-11/proceedings/papers/aycock-little/aycock-little.html#nordberg" name="CITEnordberg">13</a>] and Reflection patterns,
although it was originally inspired by the Visitor pattern [<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20010414061914/http://www.foretec.com/python/workshops/1998-11/proceedings/papers/aycock-little/aycock-little.html#GoF" name="CITEGoF">9</a>].

</p><p>
Two other design patterns can be applied to my framework too.  First, the entire
framework could be organized explicitly as a Pipes and Filters
pattern [<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20010414061914/http://www.foretec.com/python/workshops/1998-11/proceedings/papers/aycock-little/aycock-little.html#posa" name="CITEposa">4</a>].
Second, the generic classes could support interchangeable algorithms
via the Strategy pattern [<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20010414061914/http://www.foretec.com/python/workshops/1998-11/proceedings/papers/aycock-little/aycock-little.html#GoF" name="CITEGoF">9</a>]; parsing algorithms, in particular, vary
widely in their characteristics, so allowing different algorithms could
be a boon to an advanced user.

</p><p>
      </p><h2><a name="tth_sEc5">
5</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Comparison to Other Work</h2>

<p>
The basis of this paper is the observation that little languages, and
the need to implement them, are recurring problems.
Not all authors even agree on this point - Shivers [<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20010414061914/http://www.foretec.com/python/workshops/1998-11/proceedings/papers/aycock-little/aycock-little.html#shivers" name="CITEshivers">16</a>]
presents an alternative to little languages and a Scheme-based
implementation framework.  Tcl was also developed to address the
proliferation of little languages [<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20010414061914/http://www.foretec.com/python/workshops/1998-11/proceedings/papers/aycock-little/aycock-little.html#tcl" name="CITEtcl">14</a>].

</p><p>
Other Python packages exist to automate parts of scanning and
parsing.  PyLR [<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20010414061914/http://www.foretec.com/python/workshops/1998-11/proceedings/papers/aycock-little/aycock-little.html#PyLR" name="CITEPyLR">5</a>]
uses a parsing engine written in C to accelerate
parsing; kwParsing [<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20010414061914/http://www.foretec.com/python/workshops/1998-11/proceedings/papers/aycock-little/aycock-little.html#kwParsing" name="CITEkwParsing">17</a>]
automates the implementation of common programming language features
at the cost of a more complex API.  Both require precomputation of
scanning and parsing information.  YAPPS [<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20010414061914/http://www.foretec.com/python/workshops/1998-11/proceedings/papers/aycock-little/aycock-little.html#YAPPS" name="CITEYAPPS">15</a>] uses the weakest parsing
algorithm of the surveyed packages, and its author notes `It is not
fast, powerful, or particularly flexible.'  There are occasional
references to the PyBison package, which I was unable to locate.

</p><p>
For completeness, the mcf.pars package [<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20010414061914/http://www.foretec.com/python/workshops/1998-11/proceedings/papers/aycock-little/aycock-little.html#mcf.pars" name="CITEmcf.pars">7</a>] is an interesting
nontraditional system based on generalized pattern matching, but
is sufficiently different from my framework to preclude
any meaningful comparisons.

</p><p>
      </p><h2><a name="tth_sEc6">
6</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Not-so-Little Languages</h2>

<p>
This paper has presented a framework I have developed to build compilers in
Python.  It uses reflection and design patterns to produce compilers
which can be easily extended using traditional object-oriented methods.

</p><p>
At present, this framework has proved its effectiveness in the implementation of
two ``little languages.''  I plan to further test this framework by using it
to build a compiler for a larger language - Python.
