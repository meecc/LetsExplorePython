## What is Networking?

Networking is the practice of connecting multiple computing devices (such as computers {desktops, laptops and severs}, printers, data devices {NFS Servers}, sensors {remote sensing devices, GPS} etc) together in order to share resources.

Two endpoints are minimum, to create a network, as shown in the diagram below.

In the above diagram D1 & D2 are networked devices and red arrow is the networking medium. Multiple methods are used to create network such as cables, satellites, radio waves, infrared beams etc.

## Network Types

There are many types of networks available, most commonly employed networks are LAN, MAN & WAN.

* Local Area Network (LAN): These networks are used to connect devices over relatively short distances, such as within a building, school, or home. LAN's generally employ Ethernet cables or WIFI as a means of connecting the various devices within the network.

* Metropolitan Area Networks (MANs): These networks cover larger areas than LANs but smaller areas than WANs. These MANs generally span a city and are owned and operated by a government or corporations.

* Wide Area Network (WAN): These networks are used to connect devices over much larger distances than LANs. A WAN is established by using routers to connect various LANs and are generally not owned by a single person or organization. Internet is one such massive WAN which covers the entire planet & satellites.
