## Python Iterators

As common sense suggest, `Iterators` are `object` which can be iterated upon such as list, dictionary, string etc. In `Python` they are literally everywhere. 

They are `objects` which when iterated retuns one element at a time. We have already seen most of the inbuilt iterators, such as list, tuple, dictionary, string, etc. In this chapter we are going to create our own custom iterators.

There are few ways in which we can create a custom iterators.

### Class Methods

In order to create a python iterator, our custom class must implement two special methods, `__iter__()` and `__next__()`, which collectively are called the `iterator protocol`.


```python
class MyIter(object):
    def __init__(self, lst):
        self.lst = lst
        self.i = 0
    
    def __iter__(self):
        self.i = 0
        return self
    
    def __next__(self):
        if self.i < len(self.lst):
            nxt = self.lst[self.i]
            self.i +=1
            return nxt
        else:
            raise StopIteration

m = MyIter([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6])

for a in m:
    print(a)
```

    1
    2
    3
    4
    5
    6


### `iter()`

The `iter()` method returns an iterator for the given object.

**Syntax**:

```python
iter(object[, sentinel])
```

Where `object` is an object based on which the iterator needs to be constructed. The behavior of iterator is dependent on the value of `sentinel`, if `sentinel` is not provided then `object` should be an interator and the construct will behave as such, where as if `sentinel` is provided then `object` should be callable, and value returned will be treated as `next` call. Iteration ends when the value retuned equals to value in `sentinel`


```python
class MyDummy(object):
    def __init__(self):
        self.lst = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
        self.i = 0
        
    def __call__(self):
        ret = self.lst[self.i]
        self.i += 1
        return ret

d = MyDummy()


for a in iter(d, 3):
    print(a, end=" ")
```

    1
    2



```python
m = MyIter([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6])
for a in iter(m):
    print(a, end=" ")
```

    1 2 3 4 5 6 

lets try another example, this time lets take a string


```python
st = "Welcome to the city of lakes"

for a in iter(st):
    print(a, end=" ")
```

    W e l c o m e   t o   t h e   c i t y   o f   l a k e s
