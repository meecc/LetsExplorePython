    "    In computer science, imperative programming is a programming paradigm that uses statements that change a program's state. In much the same way that the imperative mood in natural languages expresses commands, an imperative program consists of commands for the computer to perform. Imperative programming focuses on describing how a program operates.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The term is often used in contrast to **declarative programming**, which focuses on what the program should accomplish without specifying how the program should achieve the result.\n",

    "* **Declarative**: \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Functional**: Every statement in functional programming is treated as mathematical equation. Also `state` or `mutable data` are avoided. Its main advantage are\n",
    "    - that any side effects due to data are avoided,\n",
    "    - good at parallel processing because there is no state, recursion and lambda calculus.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Object-oriented**: Relies on data fields that are treated as objects and manipulated only through prescribed methods. Python doesn’t fully support this coding form because it can’t implement features such as data hiding. However, this remains a useful coding style for complex applications because it supports encapsulation and polymorphism. This coding style also favors code reuse.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Procedural**: Tasks are treated as step-by-step iterations where common tasks are placed in functions that are called as needed. This coding style favors iteration, sequencing, selection, and modularization."
