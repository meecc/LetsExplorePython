### My history with Python

Till 2005, VB.NET & C were my primary programming languages. In early 2005, due to certain personal reasons, I started searching for my next primary language. My requirements for it were as stated below

- Opensource language (so I don't have to pay, no licensing issues, no change in language without some workaround for issues)
- Easy to learn (Never had too much time)
- can be compiled to exe
- GUI programming should be possible (wx)
- Relatively decent execution speed
- Decent support and usage

After about six months, and trying almost most the programming languages from (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_programming_languages), I found that python language suite most of my requirements and thus it became my first choice of programming language.
