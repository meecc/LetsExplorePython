# Python Naming Conventions

## General

* Avoid using names that are too general or too wordy. Strike a good balance between the two.
* Bad: data_structure, my_list, info_map, dictionary_for_the_purpose_of_storing_data_representing_word_definitions
* Good: user_profile, menu_options, word_definitions
* Don’t be a jackass and name things “O”, “l”, or “I”
* When using CamelCase names, capitalize all letters of an abbreviation (e.g. HTTPServer, not HttpServer)

## Packages

* Package names should be all lower case
* When multiple words are needed, an underscore should separate them
* It is usually preferable to stick to 1 word names

## Modules

* Module names should be all lower case
* When multiple words are needed, an underscore should separate them
* It is usually preferable to stick to 1 word names

## Classes

* Class names should follow the UpperCaseCamelCase convention
* Python’s built-in classes, however are typically lowercase words
* Exception classes should end in “Error”

## Global (module-level) Variables

* Global variables should be all lowercase
* Words in a global variable name should be separated by an underscore

## Instance Variables

* Instance variable names should be all lower case
* Words in an instance variable name should be separated by an underscore
* Non-public instance variables should begin with a single underscore
* If an instance name needs to be mangled, two underscores may begin its name

## Methods

* Method names should be all lower case
* Words in an method name should be separated by an underscore
* Non-public method should begin with a single underscore
* If a method name needs to be mangled, two underscores may begin its name

## Method Arguments

* Instance methods should have their first argument named ‘self’.
* Class methods should have their first argument named ‘cls’

## Functions

* Function names should be all lower case
* Words in a function name should be separated by an underscore

## Constants

* Constant names must be fully capitalized
* Words in a constant name should be separated by an underscore

## Meaning of underscores

Single or double underscores at the beginning and/or at the end of names have special meanings in Python:

* **`_single_leading_underscore`**: Weak “internal use” indicator. For example, from M import * does not import objects whose name starts with an underscore.

* **`single_trailing_underscore_`**: Used by convention to avoid conflicts with Python keyword, e.g. class_ instead of class.

* **`__double_leading_underscore`**: When naming a class attribute, invokes name mangling (inside class `FooBar, __boo becomes _FooBar__boo`)

* **`__double_leading_and_trailing_underscore__`**: “Magic” objects or attributes that live in user-controlled namespaces. E.g. `__init__, __import__ or __file__`. Never invent such names; only use them as documented.
