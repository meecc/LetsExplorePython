# Decision Trees

Decision Trees (DTs) are a non-parametric supervised learning method used for classification and regression. The goal is to create a model that predicts the value of a target variable by learning simple decision rules inferred from the data features.

For instance, say decision trees learn from data to approximate a sine curve with a set of if-then-else decision rules. 

The deeper the tree, the more complex the decision rules and the fitter the model.

## advantages of decision trees
- As trees can be visualized they are simple to understand and interpret.
- Requires little data preparation. Other techniques require data normalisation, dummy variables created and blank values removed. **Note this module does not support missing values**.
- The cost of using the tree (i.e., predicting data) is logarithmic in the number of data points used to train the tree.
- Able to handle both numerical and categorical data. Other techniques are usually specialised in analysing datasets that have only one type of variable. See algorithms for more information.
- Uses a white box model. If a given situation is observable in a model, the explanation for the condition is easily explained by boolean logic. By contrast, in a black box model (e.g., in an artificial neural network), results may be more difficult to interpret.
- Possible to validate a model using statistical tests. That makes it possible to account for the reliability of the model.
- Performs well even if its assumptions are somewhat violated by the true model from which the data were generated.


## disadvantages

- Decision-tree learners can create over-complex trees that do not generalise the data well. This is called overfitting. Mechanisms such as pruning (not currently supported), setting the minimum number of samples required at a leaf node or setting the maximum depth of the tree are necessary to avoid this problem.
- Decision trees can be unstable because small variations in the data might result in a completely different tree being generated. This problem is mitigated by using decision trees within an ensemble.
- The problem of learning an optimal decision tree is known to be NP-complete under several aspects of optimality and even for simple concepts. Consequently, practical decision-tree learning algorithms are based on heuristic algorithms such as the greedy algorithm where locally optimal decisions are made at each node. Such algorithms cannot guarantee to return the globally optimal decision tree. This can be mitigated by training multiple trees in an ensemble learner, where the features and samples are randomly sampled with replacement.
- There are concepts that are hard to learn because decision trees do not express them easily, such as XOR, parity or multiplexer problems.
- Decision tree learners create biased trees if some classes dominate. It is therefore recommended to balance the dataset prior to fitting with the decision tree.

## DecisionTreeClassifier

DecisionTreeClassifier is a class capable of performing multi-class classification on a dataset.

As with other classifiers, DecisionTreeClassifier takes as input two arrays: an array X, sparse or dense, of size [n_samples, n_features] holding the training samples, and an array Y of integer values, size [n_samples], holding the class labels for the training samples:


```python
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier as dtc

X = [[0, 0], [1, 1]]
Y = [0, 1]
clf = dtc()
clf = clf.fit(X, Y)
```

After being fitted, the model can then be used to predict the class of samples:


```python
clf.predict([[2., 2.]])
```




    array([1])



Alternatively, the probability of each class can be predicted, which is the fraction of training samples of the same class in a leaf:


```python
clf.predict_proba([[2., 2.]])
```




    array([[ 0.,  1.]])



DecisionTreeClassifier is capable of both binary (where the labels are [-1, 1]) classification and multiclass (where the labels are [0, â€¦, K-1]) classification.

iris = load_iris()

    The famous Iris database, first used by Sir R.A Fisher
    
    This is perhaps the best known database to be found in the
    pattern recognition literature.  Fisher's paper is a classic in the field and
    is referenced frequently to this day.  (See Duda & Hart, for example.)  The
    data set contains 3 classes of 50 instances each, where each class refers to a
    type of iris plant.  One class is linearly separable from the other 2; the
    latter are NOT linearly separable from each other.

## Regression

Decision trees can also be applied to regression problems, using the DecisionTreeRegressor class.

As in the classification setting, the fit method will take as argument arrays X and y, only that in this case y is expected to have floating point values instead of integer values:


```python
from sklearn import tree
X = [[0, 0], [2, 2]]
y = [0.5, 2.5]
clf = tree.DecisionTreeRegressor()
clf = clf.fit(X, y)
clf.predict([[1, 1]])
```




    array([ 0.5])




```python
print(__doc__)

# Import the necessary modules and libraries
import numpy as np
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeRegressor
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Create a random dataset
rng = np.random.RandomState(1)
X = np.sort(5 * rng.rand(80, 1), axis=0)
y = np.sin(X).ravel()
y[::5] += 3 * (0.5 - rng.rand(16))

# Fit regression model
regr_1 = DecisionTreeRegressor(max_depth=3)
regr_2 = DecisionTreeRegressor(max_depth=9)
regr_1.fit(X, y)
regr_2.fit(X, y)

# Predict
X_test = np.arange(0.0, 5.0, 0.01)[:, np.newaxis]
y_1 = regr_1.predict(X_test)
y_2 = regr_2.predict(X_test)

# Plot the results
plt.figure()
plt.scatter(X, y, s=20, edgecolor="black",
            c="darkorange", label="data")
plt.plot(X_test, y_1, color="cornflowerblue",
         label="max_depth=2", linewidth=2)
plt.plot(X_test, y_2, color="yellowgreen", label="max_depth=5", linewidth=2)
plt.xlabel("data")
plt.ylabel("target")

## Multi-output problems

A multi-output problem is a supervised learning problem with several outputs to predict, that is when Y is a 2d array of size [n_samples, n_outputs].



When there is no correlation between the outputs, a very simple way to solve this kind of problem is to build n independent models, i.e. one for each output, and then to use those models to independently predict each one of the n outputs. However, because it is likely that the output values related to the same input are themselves correlated, an often better way is to build a single model capable of predicting simultaneously all n outputs. First, it requires lower training time since only a single estimator is built. Second, the generalization accuracy of the resulting estimator may often be increased.

With regard to decision trees, this strategy can readily be used to support multi-output problems. This requires the following changes:

- Store n output values in leaves, instead of 1;
- Use splitting criteria that compute the average reduction across all n outputs.

This module offers support for multi-output problems by implementing this strategy in both DecisionTreeClassifier and DecisionTreeRegressor. If a decision tree is fit on an output array Y of size [n_samples, n_outputs] then the resulting estimator will:

- Output n_output values upon predict;
- Output a list of n_output arrays of class probabilities upon predict_proba.

The use of multi-output trees for regression is demonstrated in Multi-output Decision Tree Regression. In this example, the input X is a single real value and the outputs Y are the sine and cosine of X.

## Tips on practical use

- Decision trees tend to overfit on data with a large number of features. Getting the right ratio of samples to number of features is important, since a tree with few samples in high dimensional space is very likely to overfit.
- Consider performing dimensionality reduction (PCA, ICA, or Feature selection) beforehand to give your tree a better chance of finding features that are discriminative.
- Visualise your tree as you are training by using the export function. Use max_depth=3 as an initial tree depth to get a feel for how the tree is fitting to your data, and then increase the depth.
- Remember that the number of samples required to populate the tree doubles for each additional level the tree grows to. Use max_depth to control the size of the tree to prevent overfitting.
- Use min_samples_split or min_samples_leaf to control the number of samples at a leaf node. A very small number will usually mean the tree will overfit, whereas a large number will prevent the tree from learning the data. Try min_samples_leaf=5 as an initial value. If the sample size varies greatly, a float number can be used as percentage in these two parameters. The main difference between the two is that min_samples_leaf guarantees a minimum number of samples in a leaf, while min_samples_split can create arbitrary small leaves, though min_samples_split is more common in the literature.
- Balance your dataset before training to prevent the tree from being biased toward the classes that are dominant. Class balancing can be done by sampling an equal number of samples from each class, or preferably by normalizing the sum of the sample weights (sample_weight) for each class to the same value. Also note that weight-based pre-pruning criteria, such as min_weight_fraction_leaf, will then be less biased toward dominant classes than criteria that are not aware of the sample weights, like min_samples_leaf.
- If the samples are weighted, it will be easier to optimize the tree structure using weight-based pre-pruning criterion such as min_weight_fraction_leaf, which ensure that leaf nodes contain at least a fraction of the overall sum of the sample weights.
- All decision trees use np.float32 arrays internally. If training data is not in this format, a copy of the dataset will be made.
- If the input matrix X is very sparse, it is recommended to convert to sparse csc_matrix before calling fit and sparse csr_matrix before calling predict. Training time can be orders of magnitude faster for a sparse matrix input compared to a dense matrix when features have zero values in most of the samples.
