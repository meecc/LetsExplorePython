# ElasticNet Regression

ElasticNet is hybrid of Lasso and Ridge Regression techniques. It is trained with L1 and L2 prior as regularizer. Elastic-net is useful when there are multiple features which are correlated. Lasso is likely to pick one of these at random, while elastic-net is likely to pick both.



A practical advantage of trading-off between Lasso and Ridge is that, it allows Elastic-Net to inherit some of Ridgeâ€™s stability under rotation.



## Important Points:
- It encourages group effect in case of highly correlated variables
- There are no limitations on the number of selected variables
- It can suffer with double shrinkage

from sklearn.linear_model import ElasticNet

from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
import numpy as np
```


```python
# Import necessary modules
from sklearn.linear_model import ElasticNet
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error
from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Create train and test sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size = 0.4, random_state=42)

# Create the hyperparameter grid
l1_space = np.linspace(0, 1, 30)
param_grid = {'l1_ratio': l1_space}

# Instantiate the ElasticNet regressor: elastic_net
elastic_net = ElasticNet()

# Setup the GridSearchCV object: gm_cv
gm_cv = GridSearchCV(elastic_net, param_grid, cv=5)

# Fit it to the training data
gm_cv.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predict on the test set and compute metrics
y_pred = gm_cv.predict(X_test)
r2 = gm_cv.score(X_test, y_test)
mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)
print("Tuned ElasticNet l1 ratio: {}".format(gm_cv.best_params_))
print("Tuned ElasticNet R squared: {}".format(r2))
print("Tuned ElasticNet MSE: {}".format(mse))
