## Agenda

- What is machine learning?
- What are the two main categories of machine learning?
- What are some examples of machine learning?
- How does machine learning "work"?

## What is machine learning?

One definition: "Machine learning is the semi-automated extraction of knowledge from data"

- **Knowledge from data**: Starts with a question that might be answerable using data
- **Automated extraction**: A computer provides the insight
- **Semi-automated**: Requires many smart decisions by a human

## What are the two main categories of machine learning?

**Supervised learning**: Making predictions using data
    
- Example: Is a given email "spam" or "ham"?
- There is an outcome we are trying to predict

**Unsupervised learning**: Extracting structure from data

- Example: Segment grocery store shoppers into clusters that exhibit similar behaviors
- There is no "right answer"

## How does machine learning "work"?

High-level steps of supervised learning:

1. First, train a **machine learning model** using **labeled data**

    - "Labeled data" has been labeled with the outcome
    - "Machine learning model" learns the relationship between the attributes of the data and its outcome

2. Then, make **predictions** on **new data** for which the label is unknown

The primary goal of supervised learning is to build a model that "generalizes": It accurately predicts the **future** rather than the **past**!

## Questions about machine learning

- How do I choose **which attributes** of my data to include in the model?
- How do I choose **which model** to use?
- How do I **optimize** this model for best performance?
- How do I ensure that I'm building a model that will **generalize** to unseen data?
- Can I **estimate** how well my model is likely to perform on unseen data?
