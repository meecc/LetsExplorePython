## Create a program to 
* take the radius of a circle as inut and return the area of the circle
* take the number of sides on a polygon and return the number of diagonals within the polygon.
* take the lengths of two sides of a right-angle triangle from the user and apply the Pythagorean Theorem to find the hypotenuse.
* calculate 2^{2^{2^{2}}}
* calculate (3+2)^{4}{7}
* calculate (x + y) * (x + y)
* calculate 11111111111111111111+22222222222222222222
* get an integer (n) and computes the value of n+nn+nnn+n0n-(nn/n)*(n%(n-5)). eg: 1+11+111+101 ....
* get the volume of a sphere with radius n.
* get the volume of a cone with height h and radius r.
* get the area of a triangle when base and height is provided
* compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two positive integers
* compute the least common multiple (LCM) of two positive integers
* compute the area of polygon when number of sides are provided and length of sides are provided
* compute the distance between the points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2)
* write a Python program to print '30+20=50', when x=30 and y=20.

Q 2: **True / False**

- All mathematical operations can be performed on Strings
- Few Mathematical operations can be performed on Strings
- Addition and Subtraction have same precedence
- Multiplication and  have same precedence
- Addition and Division have same precedence
- Multiplication and Subtraction have same precedence
- Exponential have the highest precedence in the expression
- Parentheses have the highest precedence in the expression
- Addition have the highest precedence in the expression
- Multiplication have the highest precedence in the expression

Q 3: **Theory Questions**

* In which order, the Operators with the same precedence are evaluated


```python
radius = int(input("Enter the radius:"))
Area = 3.14 * radius ** 2
print("The area of the circle is " + str(Area) + "cm**2")
```

    Enter the radius:2
    The area of the circle is 12.56cm**2
