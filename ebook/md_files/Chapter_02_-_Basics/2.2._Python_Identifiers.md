## Python Identifiers aka Variables
----
In Python variable names are kind of tags/pointers to the memory location which hosts the data. We can also think of it as a labeled container that can store a **single value**. That single value can be of practically any data type. 

### Storing Values in Variables:

In python, declaration & assination of value to the variable is done at the same time. i.e. as soon as we assign a value to a non existing or existing variable, required memory location is assigned to it and appropriate data is populated in it.


```python
current_month = "MAY"
print(current_month)
```

    MAY


In the above example `current_month` is the variable name and "MAY" is the value associated with it.

#### Assignment Statements
Youâ€™ll store values in variables with an assignment statement. An assignment statement consists of a variable name, an equal sign (called the assignment operator), and the value to be stored. If you enter the assignment statement current_month = "MAY", then a variable named `current_month` will be pointing to a memory location which has the string value "MAY" stored in it.

    In Python, we do not need to declare variable explicitly. They are declared automatically when we assign any value. The assignment is done using the equal (`=`) operator as shown in the below example:


```python
current_month = "MAY" # A comment.
date = 10
```

The pictorial representation of variables from above example.

Now lets perform some actions on the variable `current_month` and observe the changes happening on it. 


```python
current_month = "JUNE"
```

In the above example we have reassigned a new value `JUNE` to variable `current_month` and it can be represented as the below image. 

![Variable after reassination](files/variable_2.png "Variable after reassination")

`current_month` was initially pointing to memory location containing value `MAY` and after reassination, it started to point to a **new** memory location containing value `JUNE` and if no other referencing the previous value, then automatically Python GC will clean it at some future time.

> **Note:** That value of MAY has not updated but a new memory was allocated for value `JUNE` and varialbe now points to it.

 Later in the chapter, we will show the above senario with more examples.

### How to find the reference count of a value


```python
########## Reference count ###################
# NOTE: Please test the below code by saving 
#       it as a file and executing it instead
#       of running it here.
#############################################
import sys

new_var = 10101010101000
print(sys.getrefcount(new_var))
```

> **NOTE**:

> The value of refcount will almost always be more than you think. It is done internally by python to optimize the code. I will be adding more details about it in "Section 2 -> Chapter: GC & Cleanup"

### Multiple Assignment:
In multiple assignment, multiple variables are assigned values in a single line. There are two ways multiple assignment can be done in python. In first format all the variables point to the same value and in next all variables point to individual values. 

#### 1. Assigning single value to multiple variables:


```python
x=y=z=1000  
print(x, y, z)
```

    1000 1000 1000


In the above example, all x, y and z are pointing to same memory location which contains 1000, which we are able to identify by checking the `id` of the variables. They are pointing to the same memory location, thus value of `id` for all three are same. 


```python
print(id(x))
print(id(y))
print(id(z))
```

    140382013287792
    140382013287792
    140382013287792


Now, lets change value of one varialbe and again check respective `id`es.


```python
x = 200
print(x)  
print(y) 
print(z)  
print(id(x))
print(id(y))
print(id(z))
```

    200
    1000
    1000
    140382238923552
    140382013287792
    140382013287792


Now, lets test something else. Can different data types impact the behavior of python memory optimization. We will first test it with integer, string and then with list.  


```python
### INTEGER 
x=1000
y=1000
z=1000  
print(x)  
print(y) 
print(z)  
print(id(x))
print(id(y))
print(id(z))
```

    1000
    1000
    1000
    140382013287568
    140382013287408
    140382013287696



```python
### String
x="1000"
y=1000
z="1000"  
print(x)  
print(y) 
print(z)  
print(id(x))
print(id(y))
print(id(z))
```

    1000
    1000
    1000
    140382016407960
    140382013287056
    140382016407960


check the id of both x and z, they are same but y is not same.


```python
### list
x = ["1000"]
y = [1000]
z = ["1000"]  
a = [1000]
print(x)  
print(y) 
print(z)  
print(a)  
print(id(x))
print(id(y))
print(id(z))
print(id(a))
```

    ['1000']
    [1000]
    ['1000']
    [1000]
    140382016254280
    140382016358024
    140382016255944
    140381903066952


#### 2. Assigning multiple values to multiple variables:


```python
x, y, z = 10, 20, 30
print(x)  
print(y) 
print(z)  
print(id(x))
print(id(y))
print(id(z))
```

    10
    20
    30
    1386049280
    1386049600
    1386049920



```python
x, y, z = 10, 120, 10
print(x)  
print(y) 
print(z)  
print(id(x))
print(id(y))
print(id(z))
```

    10
    120
    10
    1386049280
    1386052800
    1386049280


### Variable Names & Naming Conventions

There are a couple of naming conventions in use in Python:
- lower_with_underscores: Uses only lower case letters and connects multiple words with underscores.
- UPPER_WITH_UNDERSCORES: Uses only upper case letters and connects multiple words with underscores.
- CapitalWords: Capitalize the beginning of each letter in a word; no underscores. With these conventions in mind, here are the naming conventions in use.

* Variable Names: lower_with_underscores
* Constants: UPPER_WITH_UNDERSCORES
* Function Names: lower_with_underscores
* Function Parameters: lower_with_underscores
* Class Names: CapitalWords
* Method Names: lower_with_underscores
* Method Parameters and Variables: lower_with_underscores
* Always use `self` as the first parameter to a method
* To indicate privacy, precede name with a single underscore.



```python
pm_name = "Narendra Modi"
cong_vp_name = "Rahul Gandhi"
corrent_name_of_cong_wise_president = "Rahul Gandhi"
correct_name_of_conf_president = ""
cname = "RG"
```

Options can be used to override the default regular expression associated to each type. The table below lists the types, their associated options, and their default regular expressions.

|        Type       |         Default Expression        |
|:-----------------:|:-----------------------------------------:|
|      Argument     | [a-z\_][a-z0-9\_]                    |
|     Attribute     | [a-z\_][a-z0-9\_]                    |
|       Class       | [A-Z\_][a-zA-Z0-9]                       |
|      Constant     | (([A-Z\_][A-Z0-9\_]            |
|      Function     | [a-z\_][a-z0-9\_]                    |
|       Method      | [a-z\_][a-z0-9\_]                    |
|       Module      | (([a-z\_][a-z0-9\_]), ([A-Z][a-zA-Z0-9])) |
|      Variable     | [a-z\_][a-z0-9\_]                    |
| Variable, inline1 | [A-Za-z\_][A-Za-z0-9\_]                   |

Please find the invalid variables name from the below list


```python
this_is_my_number 
THIS_IS_MY_NUMBER  
ThisIsMyNumber
this_is_number 
anotherVarible
This1
this1home
1This
__sd__
_sd
```

### Good Variable Name

- Choose meaningful name instead of short name. roll_no is better than rn.
- Maintain the length of a variable name. Roll_no_of_a_student is too long?
- Be consistent; roll_no or RollNo
- Begin a variable name with an underscore(_) character for a special case.
